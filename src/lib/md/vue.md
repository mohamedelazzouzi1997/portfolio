# Vue.js

[`Vue.js`](https://vuejs.org/) is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. Developed by Evan You, Vue.js is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, making it easy to integrate into existing projects. It focuses on the view layer of an application and is often referred to as a "progressive framework" because of its versatility and adaptability.
<br/>

Vue.js enables developers to build reactive and dynamic web interfaces through a component-based architecture. It provides features like two-way data binding, a flexible directive system, and a reactive data-binding system. Vue.js is known for its simplicity, ease of integration, and efficient performance.

<br/>

Vue.js is :

- progressive: Can be adopted incrementally, allowing developers to use as much or as little of the framework as needed.
- reactive: Utilizes a reactive data-binding system, making it easy to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- component-based: Organizes applications into modular components, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
