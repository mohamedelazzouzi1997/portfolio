# Tailwind CSS

[`Tailwind CSS`](https://tailwindcss.com) is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of low-level utility classes to build modern and responsive user interfaces. Developed by Adam Wathan, Jonathan Reinink, David Hemphill, and Steve Schoger, Tailwind CSS enables developers to rapidly create well-designed and consistent UIs without the need for writing custom CSS styles.
<br/>

Tailwind CSS follows a utility-first approach, where styles are applied directly in the HTML markup using pre-defined utility classes. This approach allows for quick prototyping, easy customization, and consistent styling across projects. Tailwind also provides tools for customization, allowing developers to configure and extend the default utility classes to suit their project's design requirements.

<br/>

Tailwind CSS is :

- utility-first: Provides a comprehensive set of utility classes for styling directly in the HTML, promoting a fast and consistent development workflow.
- configurable: Offers a customizable configuration file, allowing developers to tailor the framework to meet specific design needs.
- responsive: Includes built-in responsive design classes to create mobile-friendly and adaptive layouts.
