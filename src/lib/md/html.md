# HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

[`HTML`](https://html.com/) is the standard markup language used to structure and present content on the World Wide Web. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s, HTML provides a set of elements or tags that define the structure of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. It serves as the backbone of web development, working in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing websites.
<br/>

HTML documents are composed of a nested structure of elements, forming a tree-like hierarchy. Each element carries semantic meaning, contributing to the accessibility and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) of a web page. HTML5, the latest version of HTML, introduces new elements and attributes that enhance the capabilities of web development.

<br/>

HTML is :

- semantic: Uses descriptive tags to convey the meaning and structure of content, making it accessible and search engine-friendly.
- platform-independent: Renders consistently across different browsers and devices, providing a uniform experience for users.
- foundational: Serves as the foundation for web development, facilitating the integration of styles (CSS) and interactivity (JavaScript).

## Example

```ts
<!-- Define a simple HTML document -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    </header>

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
