# GO

[`GO`](https://go.dev/) is an open-source programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrency, Go has gained popularity in the development community. It emphasizes clean and readable code, making it an excellent choice for building scalable and maintainable applications.

Go is not just a traditional interpreted language; it compiles directly to machine code, resulting in fast and efficient performance. The language is statically typed, but it feels lightweight and allows for rapid development. Go also comes with a built-in garbage collector, making memory management more straightforward for developers.

<br/>

GO is :

- compiled: Go's compilation process produces a standalone executable, eliminating the need for external runtime dependencies. This results in efficient and portable binaries.
- concise: Write clear and concise code with a focus on simplicity. Go encourages good coding practices and enforces a formatting style through the "gofmt" tool.
- complete: Go includes a standard library that covers a wide range of functionalities, from handling HTTP requests to working with databases. It provides essential tools for building robust and scalable applications without relying heavily on external packages.

## Example

```ts
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    count := 1
    doubled := count * 2

    fmt.Printf("%d * 2 = %d\n", count, doubled)

    count = count + 1
}
```
