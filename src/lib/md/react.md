# React.js

[`React`](https://react.dev/) is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed and maintained by Facebook. It is widely used for creating interactive and dynamic web applications with a focus on component-based architecture. React allows developers to build reusable UI components that efficiently update and render in response to data changes.
<br/>

React utilizes a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize rendering performance and provide a seamless user experience. It supports a unidirectional data flow, making it easy to manage state and handle complex UI updates. React can be used in conjunction with other libraries or frameworks, or as the core library in a full-stack JavaScript application.

<br/>

React.js is :

- component-based: Organizes UIs into modular and reusable components, promoting a clean and maintainable codebase.
- declarative: Uses a declarative approach to building UIs, making it easier to understand and predict the application's behavior.
- efficient: Optimizes rendering through the virtual DOM, ensuring high-performance applications.

## Example

```ts
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>React Example</h1>
			<p>{`Count: ${count}`}</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
		</div>
	);
};

export default App;
```
