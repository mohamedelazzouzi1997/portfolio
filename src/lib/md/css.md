# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

[`CSS`](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) is a styling language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. Developed as a separate technology to HTML, CSS allows developers to control the layout, appearance, and style of web pages, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user experience. CSS is essential for creating responsive and well-designed websites.
<br/>

CSS operates on a "cascading" principle, where styles can be defined at different levels and cascade down to affect elements in a hierarchical manner. It offers a wide range of styling options, including colors, fonts, spacing, and animations, providing the tools necessary to create modern and visually engaging web interfaces.

CSS is :

- styling-focused: Designed specifically for styling HTML documents, allowing developers to control the visual presentation of web content.
- flexible: Supports a variety of layout techniques, including flexbox and grid, enabling the creation of responsive and adaptive designs.
- powerful: Provides a wide range of selectors and properties for styling, allowing for intricate and detailed customization.
