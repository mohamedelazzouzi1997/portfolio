# Express.js

[`Express.js`](https://expressjs.com) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building web servers and APIs, allowing developers to focus on creating scalable and efficient applications. Express.js is widely used in the Node.js ecosystem and is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and performance.
<br/>

Express.js follows the middleware pattern, allowing developers to define a series of functions that have access to the request and response objects, making it easy to handle various aspects of the application's functionality. It also integrates seamlessly with templating engines, databases, and other Node.js modules, making it a versatile choice for web development.

## Example

```ts
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a route and handle the request
app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
	res.send('Hello, Express.js!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
	console.log(`Express.js app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
