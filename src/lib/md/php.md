# PHP

[`PHP`](https://www.php.net/)is a server-side scripting language widely used for web development. Initially created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP stands for "Hypertext Preprocessor" and is embedded within HTML code to generate dynamic web pages. It is open-source and has a large, active community, contributing to its extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
<br/>
PHP is primarily focused on web development, offering simplicity and flexibility for building websites and web applications. It supports various databases, has powerful string manipulation functions, and provides seamless integration with HTML.

PHP is :

- interpreted: PHP code is executed on the server, generating dynamic content that is sent to the client's browser. This allows developers to embed PHP directly into HTML.
- versatile: Well-suited for a wide range of web development tasks, from small scripts to large-scale applications. PHP supports multiple platforms and can be easily integrated with databases like MySQL.
- community-driven: With a large and active community, PHP benefits from continuous improvements, security updates, and a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks.
