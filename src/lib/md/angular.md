# Angular

[`Angular`](https://angular.io/docs) is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application framework maintained by Google and a community of developers. It is part of the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack and is widely used for building single-page applications (SPAs) and dynamic web applications. Angular provides a comprehensive set of tools and features to simplify the development process and enhance the scalability and maintainability of projects.
<br/>

Angular follows a component-based architecture, where applications are composed of modular components that encapsulate the logic, template, and styling. It includes features such as two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a powerful command-line interface (CLI) for scaffolding and building projects. Angular also integrates seamlessly with RxJS for handling asynchronous operations.

<br/>

Angular is :

- modular: Organizes applications into reusable and maintainable components, promoting a modular and scalable architecture.
- declarative: Uses a declarative approach to building UIs, making it easier to reason about and test the application.
- full-featured: Provides a rich set of tools and libraries for features like routing, forms, HTTP client, animations, and more.

## Example

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
	selector: 'app-root',
	template: `
		<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
		<p>Welcome to Angular!</p>
	`,
	styles: [
		`
			h1 {
				color: #0077cc;
			}
		`
	]
})
export class AppComponent {
	title = 'My Angular App';
}
```
