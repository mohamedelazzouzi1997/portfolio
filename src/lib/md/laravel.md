# Laravel

[`Laravel`](https://laravel.com) is a powerful and elegant PHP web application framework designed for developers who value clean, expressive, and efficient code. Created by Taylor Otwell, Laravel follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a wide range of features to streamline the development process.

Laravel emphasizes simplicity and readability, making it an ideal choice for building modern web applications. It includes a robust ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) called Eloquent, a powerful template engine called Blade, and a convenient command-line interface called Artisan.
