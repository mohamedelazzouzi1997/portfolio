# JS

[`JS`](https://www.javascript.com/) is a versatile and widely-used programming language that powers dynamic content on the web. Developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, JavaScript is an essential part of web development, enabling interactive and responsive user experiences. It is a high-level, interpreted language that can be executed in web browsers, making it a client-side scripting language.

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, has evolved over the years and is now used not only for front-end development but also for server-side development (Node.js). It supports a wide range of frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, making it a powerful tool for building modern web applications.

JavaScript is :

- interpreted: Executed directly by web browsers, enabling dynamic changes to web pages and interactions with users.
- versatile: Used for both client-side and server-side development, making it a key language for full-stack development.
- ubiquitous: Supported by all major web browsers, ensuring compatibility and accessibility for a vast audience.
